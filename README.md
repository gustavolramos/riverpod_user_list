# riverpod_user_list

This Flutter project utilizes Riverpod to display a list of users from a mocked API

## What did I use in this project?

- AsyncValue, Providers, etc with the "flutter_riverpod" package
- Futures, API Requests, JSON parsing, etc with the "http" package
- An example API from MockAPI (https://mockapi.io/) to help create the user list with the desired properties.

## For context

I've been looking for a small project to implement something that benefits from state management.

Even though his is still only a small user list, it showcases how easy it can be to work with async data using Riverpod.

Feel free to provide me with feedback :)
